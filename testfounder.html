                    <h2>Meet our Expedition leader</h2>
                    <p>Roshni has been passionate about classical dance, painting, and singing from a young age, immersing herself in various art forms that have shaped her creative mindset. Eager to pursue her love for the arts, she traveled to Singapore and the UK to study art and design. During this journey, she embarked on her first solo trip to the Netherlands, a transformative experience that sparked her love for exploration. From that point on, she made it a habit to save and travel each year, whether the trips were big or small.</p>
